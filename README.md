# Welcome to the Salesforce Code Builder Pilot!

Welcome to the next chapter in the Salesforce Developer Experience! Have you wanted to try some of our newer, modern tooling but didn't want the overhead of installing and configuring it locally? Would you like flexibility in how and where you work, from any computer? Do you want the power of a feature-rich development environment that's integrated with Salesforce? 

Step right up. Code Builder is here. This web-based integrated development environment provides all the power and flexibility of Salesforce Extensions for VS Code and Salesforce CLI in your web browser -- the tools you want, optimized to do Salesforce work easily and productively. 

This repository is your one-stop shop for pilot interaction. We are funneling all feedback and documentation here so that you don't have to go digging to find things, and we can engage with you all in one place. This is a private shared repository. Only Code Builder pilot users and Salesforce Developer Tooling employees have access to it. 


## We Want Your Feedback

We really appreciate your participation in the Code Builder pilot. Your feedback will help shape the future of Code Builder as well as our other Development tools. Provide feedback often in the form of issues in the repository. We are looking for general impressions and feedback on how this tool helps you in your current workflow, feature requests, and bugs. There are templates for each type of feedback. We look forward to hearing from you.

Feel free to be direct in your feedback but also remember that there are humans reading your comments, so please be respectful. Also, provide feedback only in this repository or directly to the Code Builder development team. Reserve public feedback for after pilot.
